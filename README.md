[this post.](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

How To Play

Type or use the + and - buttons to put in your date of birth.
The ++ and -- buttons go up and down by ten respectively.

Then press the buttons for the average Male, Average, or Female life expectancy in the US. (2016)
Or type, or use the buttons to put in a custom age to end the calendar at.

Marvel at the result.
